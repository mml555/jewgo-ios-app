# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for investigating and fixing build issues and LiveMap page failures in the JEWGO React Native iOS application. The system needs to ensure reliable builds and proper functionality of the map-based features.

## Glossary

- **Build_System**: The iOS build process using Xcode, CocoaPods, and React Native CLI
- **LiveMap_Screen**: The map-based screen component that displays business locations with clustering
- **Metro_Bundler**: The JavaScript bundler for React Native applications
- **Hermes_Engine**: The JavaScript engine used by React Native for performance optimization
- **Map_Clustering**: The system for grouping nearby map markers to improve performance
- **Native_Map_Component**: The react-native-maps based map implementation with Google Maps provider

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the iOS build process to complete successfully without errors, so that I can test and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process is initiated, THE Build_System SHALL complete without rsync sandbox errors
2. WHEN CocoaPods dependencies are installed, THE Build_System SHALL resolve all framework dependencies correctly
3. WHEN Hermes engine is configured, THE Build_System SHALL handle framework copying without sandbox violations
4. WHERE build errors occur, THE Build_System SHALL provide clear diagnostic information
5. WHILE building for iOS simulator, THE Build_System SHALL use appropriate deployment targets and architectures

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the LiveMap screen to load and display business locations properly, so that I can view nearby Jewish businesses on a map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the LiveMap screen is accessed, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL render the map component without crashes
2. WHEN business data is available, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL display location markers on the map
3. WHEN multiple businesses are nearby, THE Map_Clustering SHALL group markers appropriately
4. WHEN a user taps a marker, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL display business details in a popup
5. WHERE no data is available, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL show appropriate fallback content

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and diagnostics for map-related issues, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN map components fail to load, THE Native_Map_Component SHALL provide meaningful error messages
2. WHEN clustering fails, THE Map_Clustering SHALL gracefully degrade to show individual markers
3. WHEN location permissions are denied, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL display appropriate user guidance
4. WHERE API data is malformed, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL handle data validation errors gracefully
5. WHILE debugging, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build system to be resilient to common iOS development issues, so that builds are reliable across different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sandbox restrictions are encountered, THE Build_System SHALL use absolute paths for system tools
2. WHEN framework copying fails, THE Build_System SHALL provide alternative copy mechanisms
3. WHEN dependency conflicts occur, THE Build_System SHALL resolve version compatibility issues
4. WHERE Xcode versions differ, THE Build_System SHALL maintain compatibility across supported versions
5. WHILE cleaning builds, THE Build_System SHALL properly reset all cached artifacts

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the map interface to be responsive and performant, so that I can smoothly navigate and interact with business locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the map loads, THE Native_Map_Component SHALL render within 3 seconds
2. WHEN zooming or panning, THE Map_Clustering SHALL update markers smoothly
3. WHEN filtering businesses, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL update displayed markers within 1 second
4. WHERE many markers are present, THE Map_Clustering SHALL maintain 60fps performance
5. WHILE interacting with popups, THE LiveMap_Screen SHALL respond to touch events within 100ms
