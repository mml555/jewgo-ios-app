# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines comprehensive improvements to the JEWGO React Native application based on a thorough codebase review. The improvements focus on code quality, maintainability, performance, testing, accessibility, and developer experience. These enhancements will transform the current codebase into a more robust, scalable, and maintainable application while preserving all existing functionality.

4. WHEN running the test suite THEN it SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
5. WHEN testing user interactions THEN there SHALL be end-to-end tests for critical user flows
6. WHEN tests run THEN they SHALL complete in under 30 seconds for the full suite

### Requirement 5: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the app to be fast and responsive, so that I can efficiently browse and interact with Jewish community businesses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading screens THEN they SHALL render within 2 seconds on average devices

6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all functionality SHALL be accessible

### Requirement 7: State Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want my preferences and data to be consistent across the app, so that I have a seamless experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting user preferences THEN they SHALL persist across app sessions
2. WHEN favoriting items THEN the state SHALL be consistent across all screens
3. WHEN user authentication is implemented THEN the state SHALL be managed globally
4. WHEN offline data is available THEN it SHALL be synchronized when connectivity returns
5. WHEN app state changes THEN related components SHALL update automatically
