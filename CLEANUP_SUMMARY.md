# Codebase Cleanup Summary - Quick Reference

**Last Updated:** October 17, 2025

## ✅ What Was Done

1. **Documentation Organized** - Moved 15+ files from root to `docs/` folders
2. **Logs Cleaned** - Removed 468KB of log files
3. **Scripts Organized** - iOS utilities moved to `scripts/ios-utilities/`
4. **Duplicates Identified** - Found 3 duplicate screen files needing consolidation
5. **Dependencies Audited** - Analyzed 64 dependencies, identified issues

## ⚠️ Action Required

### CRITICAL: Duplicate Screen Files

Three screens exist in two locations with inconsistent usage:

- `JobDetailScreen` - Old version used, V2 version unused
- `JobSeekerDetailScreen` - V2 version used, old version unused
- `CreateJobScreen` - Both versions exist

**Action:** Consolidate to use only V2 versions in `src/screens/jobs/`

### Review Needed

- Verify if Stripe integration is planned (remove dependency if not)
- Add `react-native-reanimated` to devDependencies if tests need it
