# Eatery Tag Final Fix - Complete Data Flow

## Update: Removed Duplicate Dietary Chip

After the initial fix, eatery cards were showing two elements with dietary type:
1. Top-left white tag with dietary type (Meat/Dairy/Parve)
2. Bottom-left color-coded dietary chip

**Solution**: Removed the bottom-left dietary chip and kept only the top-left white tag for consistency with other categories. All cards now have a single white tag in the top-left corner.

# Original Fix Documentation

## Problem
Eatery cards were still showing "Kosher" instead of the actual dietary type (Meat, Dairy, or Parve) even after adding the field to interfaces.

## Root Cause
The `transformListing` function in `useCategoryData.ts` was not passing through the `kosher_level` field from the API response to the CategoryItem. The data was being lost during transformation.

## Complete Data Flow (Before Fix)

```
Backend API
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat')
api.ts transformEntityToLegacyListing
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ PASSED THROUGH
Listing interface
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ HAS FIELD
useCategoryData transformListing
  ↓ (kosher_level: undefined) ❌ LOST HERE!
CategoryItem
  ↓ (kosher_level: undefined)
CategoryCard
  ↓ Shows: "Kosher" (fallback)
```

## Solution

### Updated `transformListing` in `src/hooks/useCategoryData.ts`

Added pass-through of all eatery-specific and additional API fields:

```typescript
const safeItem: CategoryItem = {
  // ... existing fields ...
  hasDelivery: false,
  // Pass through eatery-specific fields from API
  kosher_level: listing.kosher_level, // Dietary type: 'meat' | 'dairy' | 'parve'
  kosher_certification: listing.kosher_certification,
  price_min: listing.price_min,
  price_max: listing.price_max,
  price_range: listing.price_range,
  // Pass through additional API fields
  entity_type: listing.category_id,
  address: listing.address,
  city: listing.city,
  state: listing.state,
  review_count: listing.review_count,
  image_url: listing.images?.[0],
};
```

### Added Debug Logging in `src/components/CategoryCard.tsx`

Added conditional debug logging to help troubleshoot data issues:

```typescript
{(() => {
  if (categoryKey === 'eatery') {
    // Debug logging for eatery cards
    if (__DEV__ && Math.random() < 0.1) {
      debugLog('🍽️ Eatery card data:', {
        title: item.title,
        kosher_level: item.kosher_level,
        hasKosherLevel: !!item.kosher_level,
        itemKeys: Object.keys(item),
      });
    }
    return item.kosher_level ? getDietaryLabel(item.kosher_level) : 'Kosher';
  }
  return String(item.category || 'Unknown');
})()}
```

## Complete Data Flow (After Fix)

```
Backend API
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat')
api.ts transformEntityToLegacyListing
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ PASSED THROUGH
Listing interface
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ HAS FIELD
useCategoryData transformListing
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ NOW PASSED THROUGH!
CategoryItem
  ↓ (kosher_level: 'meat') ✅ HAS VALUE
CategoryCard
  ↓ getDietaryLabel('meat')
User sees: "Meat" ✅ CORRECT!
```

## Files Modified

1. **src/hooks/useCategoryData.ts**
   - Updated `transformListing` to pass through `kosher_level` and other eatery fields
   - Added all missing API fields to the transformation

2. **src/components/CategoryCard.tsx**
   - Added debug logging to help identify data issues
   - Logging shows actual data structure for troubleshooting

## Testing

To verify the fix works:

1. **Check Debug Logs**
   ```
   Look for: 🍽️ Eatery card data: { kosher_level: 'meat', ... }
   ```

2. **Visual Verification**
   - Meat restaurants should show "Meat" tag
   - Dairy restaurants should show "Dairy" tag
   - Parve restaurants should show "Parve" tag
   - Restaurants without kosher_level show "Kosher" (fallback)

3. **Dietary Chip**
   - Bottom-left chip should also show correct type with color:
     - Meat: Red (#EB7777)
     - Dairy: Blue (#71BBFF)
     - Parve: Yellow (#FFCE6D)

## Why This Happened

The `transformListing` function was creating a "safe" CategoryItem with default values but wasn't copying over the optional fields from the API response. This is a common pattern to ensure type safety, but it needs to explicitly pass through all relevant fields.

## Prevention

When adding new fields to the API response:
1. Add to `Listing` interface in `api.ts` ✅
2. Pass through in `transformEntityToLegacyListing` ✅
3. Add to `CategoryItem` interface ✅
4. **Pass through in `transformListing`** ✅ (This was missing!)
5. Use in components ✅

## Related Changes

This fix also passes through other useful fields that were being lost:
- `entity_type` - Entity type from backend
- `address`, `city`, `state` - Full address details
- `review_count` - Number of reviews
- `image_url` - Direct image URL
- `price_min`, `price_max`, `price_range` - Pricing information
- `kosher_certification` - Hechsher certification

These fields are now available for use in other components as well.
