- **Result:** Consistent development environment

### 7. Environment Documentation ✅
- Created: `.env.example` (frontend, 15 variables)
- Created: `.env.example` (backend, 30+ variables)
- **Result:** Better onboarding, fewer configuration errors

### 8. react-native-maps Upgrade ✅

- Gesture Handler: **2.28.0 → 2.20.2** (stable)
- Screens: **4.17.1 → 4.4.0** (Kotlin compatible)
- Removed incompatible patches
- **Result:** All libraries working together

### 10. Expo Dependencies Removed ✅
- Cleaned MainActivity.kt (removed ReactActivityDelegateWrapper)
- Cleaned MainApplication.kt (removed ApplicationLifecycleDispatcher)
- Cleaned settings.gradle (removed Expo plugins)
- Cleaned build.gradle (removed expo-root-project)
- **Result:** Pure React Native without Expo overhead

## 🔴 Known Limitations

### Library Version Constraints:
Some libraries were downgraded from their latest versions for Kotlin 1.8.22 compatibility:

- **Stripe:** 0.55.0 → 0.39.0 (requires Compose Compiler 1.3.2)
- **Gesture Handler:** 2.28.0 → 2.20.2
- **Screens:** 4.17.1 → 4.4.0

These can be upgraded later when Kotlin 2.x support is stable across the ecosystem.
