## üö® If You See Issues

### Grid Not Showing Correct Columns?

1. Check console for any errors
2. Verify orientation (portrait vs landscape)
3. Try force-quitting simulator and relaunch

### UI Elements Too Small/Large?

1. This is expected variation
2. Scaling can be fine-tuned in `deviceAdaptation.ts`
3. Adjust multipliers (currently 1.2x fonts, 1.3x spacing)

### App Crashes on Launch?

1. Check Metro bundler is running
2. Clear cache: `npm start -- --reset-cache`
3. Rebuild: `npx react-native run-ios`
