# Quick Setup Guide: Business Jobs Feature

## TL;DR - 3 Steps to Enable

```bash
# 1. Apply database migration
cd database/scripts
./apply_business_jobs_migration.sh

# 2. Restart backend
cd ../../backend
npm restart

# 3. Done! Visit any business listing page
```

## What This Adds

âœ… "I'm Hiring" section on business listing pages  
âœ… Job cards showing About (200 chars) and Requirements (250 chars)  
âœ… Horizontal scrollable job list  
âœ… "View All" link to see all jobs from the business

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Database Migration

```bash
# Set your database URL (if not already set)
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@host:port/database"

# Run migration script
cd /Users/mendell/JewgoAppFinal/database/scripts
./apply_business_jobs_migration.sh
```

**What it does:**

- Adds `business_entity_id` column to `job_listings` table
- Creates performance index
- Updates analytics views

### 2. Verify Migration

```bash
# Check if column was added
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'job_listings' AND column_name = 'business_entity_id';"
```

**Expected output:**

```
      column_name      | data_type
-----------------------+-----------
 business_entity_id    | uuid
```

### 3. Restart Backend

```bash
cd /Users/mendell/JewgoAppFinal/backend
npm restart
# or
pm2 restart jewgo-backend
```

### 4. Test the Feature

#### A. Create a Job Linked to a Business

**API Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-api.com/jobs/listings \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "jobTitle": "Restaurant Manager",
    "industryId": "your-industry-id",
    "jobTypeId": "your-job-type-id",
    "compensationStructureId": "your-comp-structure-id",
    "salaryMin": 5000000,
    "salaryMax": 7000000,
    "zipCode": "10001",
    "description": "Manage daily restaurant operations, staff scheduling, and customer service in our kosher establishment.",
    "requirements": "3+ years restaurant management, food safety certification, experience with POS systems, excellent communication skills, kosher kitchen knowledge preferred.",
    "businessEntityId": "uuid-of-your-restaurant"
  }'
```

#### B. View Jobs on Business Page

1. Open the mobile app
2. Navigate to any business listing (restaurant, store, etc.)
3. Scroll down past "Business Specials"
4. Look for "ðŸ’¼ I'm Hiring" section
5. See job cards with truncated text

#### C. Test API Filter

```bash
# Get jobs for a specific business
curl "https://your-api.com/jobs/listings?business_id=BUSINESS_UUID&limit=3"

# Get jobs by employer
curl "https://your-api.com/jobs/listings?employer_id=USER_UUID"
```

## Files Changed

### Database

```
âœ… database/migrations/024_add_business_entity_to_jobs.sql
âœ… database/scripts/apply_business_jobs_migration.sh
```

### Backend

```
âœ… backend/src/controllers/jobsController.js
   - Added businessEntityId parameter to createJobListing
   - Added business_id and employer_id filters to getJobListings
```

### Frontend

```
âœ… src/components/BusinessJobsSection.tsx (NEW)
   - Displays job cards on business pages
   - Truncates About to 200 chars
   - Truncates Requirements to 250 chars

âœ… src/screens/ListingDetailScreen.tsx
   - Integrated BusinessJobsSection component

âœ… src/services/JobsService.ts
   - Added business_id and employer_id filter support
```

## Common Issues

### Issue 1: Migration Fails

**Error:** `column "business_entity_id" already exists`

**Solution:** Migration already applied, skip to step 2.

### Issue 2: Jobs Not Showing

**Check:**

1. Does the business have active jobs?
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM job_listings WHERE business_entity_id = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_ID';
   ```
2. Is the business ID correct?
3. Are jobs set to `is_active = true`?

### Issue 3: API Returns Empty

**Check:**

1. Backend restarted after migration?
2. Correct query parameter: `business_id` not `businessId`
3. Using GET not POST

## Sample Data

### Create Sample Jobs for Testing

```sql
-- Get a business ID
SELECT id, name, entity_type FROM entities WHERE entity_type = 'restaurant' LIMIT 1;

-- Create sample job (replace UUIDs with real ones)
INSERT INTO job_listings (
  employer_id,
  business_entity_id,
  job_title,
  description,
  requirements,
  industry_id,
  job_type_id,
  compensation_structure_id,
  zip_code,
  status
) VALUES (
  'your-user-id',
  'your-business-id',
  'Kitchen Manager',
  'Oversee kitchen operations, manage staff, ensure food quality and safety standards.',
  'Culinary degree or equivalent experience, 3+ years in commercial kitchen, ServSafe certified, leadership skills.',
  (SELECT id FROM job_industries WHERE key = 'hospitality'),
  (SELECT id FROM job_types WHERE key = 'full_time'),
  (SELECT id FROM compensation_structures WHERE key = 'salary'),
  '10001',
  'active'
);
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Migration applied successfully
- [ ] Backend restarted
- [ ] Can create job with `businessEntityId`

## Next Steps

1. **Populate Jobs:** Add real job listings for your businesses
2. **Business Dashboard:** Let business owners post jobs from their dashboard
3. **Analytics:** Track how many applications come from business pages
4. **Featured Jobs:** Highlight certain positions
5. **Auto-linking:** When user creates job, auto-link to their business

## Rollback Instructions

If needed, rollback the changes:

```bash
# Run rollback SQL
psql $DATABASE_URL <<EOF
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS business_hiring_summary;
ALTER TABLE job_listings DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS business_entity_id;
EOF

# Restart backend
cd backend && npm restart
```

Then remove the frontend component from `ListingDetailScreen.tsx`.

## Support

**Check migration status:**

```sql
SELECT
  table_name,
  column_name,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'job_listings'
  AND column_name = 'business_entity_id';
```

**Check existing jobs:**

```sql
SELECT
  id,
  job_title,
  business_entity_id,
  status
FROM job_listings
LIMIT 5;
```

**View business hiring summary:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM business_hiring_summary LIMIT 10;
```
