# Quick Verification Guide

Run these commands to verify all fixes are working:

## 1. Verify AsyncStorage Migration

```bash
# Should return 0 (no AsyncStorage imports except in SafeAsyncStorage)
grep -r "import AsyncStorage" src/services/ | grep -v SafeAsyncStorage | wc -l

# Should return 0 (no direct AsyncStorage calls)
grep -r "AsyncStorage\." src/services/*.ts | grep -v "safeAsyncStorage\." | grep -v SafeAsyncStorage.ts | wc -l
```

## 2. Check Linter

```bash
# Should show no errors
npx eslint src/services/SafeAsyncStorage.ts
npx eslint src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
npx eslint src/components/ScreenErrorBoundary.tsx
```

## 3. Verify Route Validation

Check these files have validation:
- src/screens/StoreDetailScreen.tsx
- src/screens/ProductDetailScreen.tsx
- src/screens/ProductManagementScreen.tsx
- src/screens/EditStoreScreen.tsx
- src/screens/EditSpecialScreen.tsx
- src/screens/ListingDetailScreen.tsx
- src/screens/StoreSpecialsScreen.tsx
- src/screens/LiveMapScreen.tsx
- src/screens/AddCategoryScreen.tsx

## 4. Test Error Boundaries

```bash
# Check files exist
ls -l src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx
ls -l src/components/ScreenErrorBoundary.tsx

# Check integration
grep -n "ErrorBoundary" src/App.tsx
grep -n "ScreenErrorBoundary" src/navigation/RootNavigator.tsx
```

## 5. Quick Smoke Test

```bash
# Build the app
npm run build # or
npx react-native run-ios # or
npx react-native run-android

# Watch for errors during startup
# Navigate to different screens
# Test form filling and saving
# Test authentication flows
```

## Expected Results

✅ All verification commands should pass  
✅ No crashes during navigation  
✅ Storage operations work reliably  
✅ Error boundaries catch errors gracefully  

## If Issues Found

1. Check logs: `tail -f logs/backend.log`
2. Check error boundaries: Look for fallback UI
3. Check storage: Try clearing app data
4. Review: FINAL_TEST_REPORT.md

## Success Indicators

- [ ] AsyncStorage migration: 0 imports, 0 direct calls
- [ ] Linter: No errors
- [ ] Route validation: All 9 screens protected
- [ ] Error boundaries: Integrated in 3 places
- [ ] App starts without crashes
- [ ] Navigation works smoothly
- [ ] Forms save/restore correctly
- [ ] Auth flows work correctly

**If all checked: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT**
