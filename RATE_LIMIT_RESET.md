# Rate Limit Reset - Complete

## Issue

Guest endpoint was rate limited from testing, preventing the app from creating guest sessions.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Reset Rate Limit Counts ✅

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3001/api/v5/admin/rate-limit/reset-counts'
```

Result: Reset 0 request count(s)

### 2. Clear Blocked IPs ✅

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:3001/api/v5/admin/rate-limit/clear-blocks'
```

Result: Cleared 0 blocked IP(s)

### 3. Fixed Guest Endpoint Path ✅

**Problem:** I incorrectly changed the guest endpoint from `/guest/create` to `/auth/guest/create`

**Correct Path:** `/api/v5/guest/create`

**Fixed in:** `src/services/GuestService.ts` (Line 136)

### 4. Restarted Backend ✅

Backend restarted in development mode with lenient rate limiting:

- Guest create: 10,000 requests/hour (vs 10 in production)
- Guest general: 10,000 requests/15min (vs 50 in production)
- Localhost requests skip rate limiting entirely

## Rate Limiting Configuration (Development Mode)

### Guest Endpoints

```javascript
// backend/src/routes/guest.js
const guestCreateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 60 * 1000, // 1 hour
  max: isDevelopment ? 10000 : 10, // Very high in dev
  skip: req => {
    // Skip rate limiting for localhost in development
    if (isDevelopment) {
      const ip = req.ip || req.connection.remoteAddress;
      return ip === '127.0.0.1' || ip === '::1' || ip === '::ffff:127.0.0.1';
    }
    return false;
  },
});
```

### Skip Paths

```javascript
// backend/src/middleware/rateLimiter.js
skipPaths: ['/health', '/api/v5/health', '/api/v5/guest/create'];
```

## Current Status

✅ Rate limits reset
✅ No blocked IPs
✅ Backend running in development mode
✅ Guest endpoint path corrected
✅ Localhost requests skip rate limiting
⏳ App needs rebuild to apply guest endpoint fix

## Next Steps

1. Rebuild app to apply the corrected guest endpoint path
2. Test guest session creation
3. Verify price ranges display correctly

## Admin Endpoints (Development Only)

```bash
# Get rate limit stats
GET /api/v5/admin/rate-limit/stats

# Reset all request counts
POST /api/v5/admin/rate-limit/reset-counts

# Clear all blocked IPs
POST /api/v5/admin/rate-limit/clear-blocks

# Clear specific IP
POST /api/v5/admin/rate-limit/clear-ip/:ip
```

Note: These endpoints require authentication and are only available in development mode.
