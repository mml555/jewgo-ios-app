## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### No Code Changes

- **No source code was modified** - Only organizational changes
- **No functionality affected** - All moves, no logic changes
- **Safe to commit** - No breaking changes

### Files Not Lost

All "deleted" files were moved to better locations:

- Root docs ‚Üí `docs/project-summaries/`
- Script docs ‚Üí `docs/project-summaries/`
- iOS utilities ‚Üí `scripts/ios-utilities/`

### Log Files

Log files were deleted (not tracked by git anyway):

- `logs/backend.log`
- `logs/backend-new.log`
- These regenerate automatically when backend runs

## üîç Verify Changes

Before committing, verify nothing was lost:

```bash
# Check that moved files exist
ls -la docs/project-summaries/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
ls -la scripts/ios-utilities/clean-fonts.rb

# Verify new documentation
ls -la docs/CODEBASE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY_2025.md
ls -la docs/CODE_QUALITY_FINDINGS.md

# Check new script
ls -la scripts/check-code-quality.sh
test -x scripts/check-code-quality.sh && echo "Script is executable ‚úÖ"

# Verify root is cleaner
ls -1 | wc -l  # Should show ~31 files
```
