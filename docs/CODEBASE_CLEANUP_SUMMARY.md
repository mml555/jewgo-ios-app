### 4. Cleanup ✅

- **Removed temporary files:**

  - diff.txt (empty file)

- **Root directory now contains only:**
  - README.md (main project readme)
  - Essential config files (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.)
  - Core directories (src/, android/, ios/, backend/, database/)

## Benefits

### Improved Maintainability

- Cleaner root directory makes navigation easier
- Organized documentation is easier to find and reference
- Test scripts are grouped together for better discoverability

### Better Security

- Sensitive credentials no longer in version control
- Follows security best practices for environment variables

### Enhanced Code Quality

- Component improvements reduce memory leaks
- Better error handling and user experience
- Improved type safety

### Developer Experience

- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Clear project structure
- Better organization of resources

## Next Steps for Team Members

1. **Create `.env` file:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Then fill in your actual credentials
   ```

2. **Update script references:**

   - If you have any scripts or documentation that reference the old paths, update them to:
     - `scripts/testing/test-*.sh` for test scripts
     - `docs/project-summaries/*.md` for documentation

3. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```

## Statistics

- **Total files moved:** 51
- **Files deleted:** 2 (diff.txt, .env from git)
- **Directories created:** 2 (docs/project-summaries/, scripts/testing/)
- **Commits:** 2
- **Lines changed:** ~200+
