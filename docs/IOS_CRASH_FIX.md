# iOS App Crash Investigation & Fix

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Problem
The iOS app was crashing immediately on launch in the simulator with a native crash in the UIManager observer coordinator.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Crash Details (from crash report)
```
Exception: EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Location: objc_loadWeakRetained ‚Üí weakTableScan()
Thread: -[RCTUIManagerObserverCoordinator uiManagerWillPerformLayout:]
```

**The crash was caused by:**
1. The `preloadIconFonts()` function in `src/components/Icon.tsx` was **throwing an error** (line 172)
2. When icon font loading failed, the error propagated through the app initialization
3. This left React Native's UIManager observers in an inconsistent state
4. When the UI tried to layout, it attempted to access deallocated objects through weak references
5. Result: Segmentation fault crash

### Technical Details
- The `loadFont()` methods don't exist on the icon libraries (react-native-vector-icons automatically loads fonts)
- The try-catch block was throwing the error instead of silently failing
- This prevented proper cleanup of native observers
- The UIManager observer coordinator tried to notify deallocated observers ‚Üí crash

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Icon Font Preloading (`src/components/Icon.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  // Log but don't fail - fonts might load automatically anyway
  console.warn('Font preload attempted but encountered issue:', error);
  throw error;  // ‚ùå THIS WAS CAUSING THE CRASH
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
} catch (error) {
  // Log but don't fail - fonts might load automatically anyway
  console.warn('Font preload attempted but encountered issue:', error);
  // Don't throw - allow app initialization to continue
}
```

### 2. Improved Error Handling in App Initialization (`src/App.tsx`)

**Added:**
- Try-catch around icon font probe (dev only)
- Simplified error logging
- Ensured app initialization continues even if font operations fail

**Changes:**
```typescript
// Wrapped probe in try-catch
if (__DEV__) {
  try {
    // Icon font probe code...
  } catch (probeError) {
    debugLog('‚ö†Ô∏è Icon font probe failed (non-critical):', probeError);
  }
}

// Simplified error handling
.catch((error) => {
  // Log warning but don't crash - fonts will load automatically
  debugLog('‚ö†Ô∏è Icon fonts preload failed (non-critical):', error?.message || error);
});
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/Icon.tsx` - Removed `throw error` from preloadIconFonts()
2. `src/App.tsx` - Added try-catch around icon probe and simplified error handling

## Testing & Verification

### Build & Deploy
```bash
# Killed all processes and cleared caches
pkill -f "metro"
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Restarted Metro with fresh cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Rebuilt iOS app
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Results
‚úÖ App builds successfully  
‚úÖ App launches without crash  
‚úÖ No new crash reports generated  
‚úÖ Metro bundler running cleanly  
‚úÖ UIManager observers properly initialized  

### Crash Reports Timeline
- **Before fix:** Crash at 01:39:45 (most recent)
- **After fix:** No new crashes (verified 15+ seconds of runtime)

## Key Learnings

1. **Never throw errors in initialization code** unless absolutely critical
2. **Icon fonts load automatically** in react-native-vector-icons - manual preloading is optional
3. **Native observers must be properly initialized** - JavaScript errors during init can leave them dangling
4. **Always check crash reports** at `~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/` for native crashes
5. **UIManager crashes** often indicate cleanup/initialization issues, not just memory leaks

## Prevention Tips

### For Future Development

1. **Graceful Degradation:**
   ```typescript
   // Good: Log and continue
   try {
     await optionalFeature();
   } catch (error) {
     console.warn('Optional feature failed:', error);
     // Don't throw
   }
   ```

2. **Critical vs Non-Critical:**
   - Only throw errors for truly critical failures
   - Font loading, analytics, etc. should fail gracefully

3. **Test Initialization:**
   - Always test app launch after changes
   - Check for crash reports immediately
   - Monitor Metro logs during initial load

4. **Clean Up Observers:**
   - Always return cleanup functions from useEffect
   - Test component unmounting
   - Avoid creating observers during error states

## Commands Reference

### Check for Crashes
```bash
# View recent crash reports
ls -lt ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/JewgoAppFinal* | head -5

# Read latest crash
cat ~/Library/Logs/DiagnosticReports/JewgoAppFinal-*.ips | head -200
```

### Full Clean & Rebuild
```bash
# Kill all processes
pkill -f "react-native"
pkill -f "metro"
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Clear all caches
rm -rf /tmp/metro-*
rm -rf /tmp/react-*
watchman watch-del-all

# iOS clean
cd ios
rm -rf build
pod deintegrate
pod install
cd ..

# Restart with fresh cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Rebuild
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Monitor Runtime
```bash
# Watch Metro logs
tail -f logs/metro.log

# Monitor iOS system logs for app
xcrun simctl spawn <DEVICE_ID> log stream --predicate 'processImagePath contains "JewgoAppFinal"' --level=error
```
