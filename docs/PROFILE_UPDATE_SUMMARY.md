## Testing Checklist

âœ… PaymentInfoScreen displays correctly and navigates back
âœ… DashboardAnalyticsScreen loads and displays stats
âœ… DashboardAnalyticsScreen handles listing navigation
âœ… ProfileScreen UI matches reference design
âœ… Stats cards display loading states
âœ… Notification bell navigates to Notifications tab
âœ… Dashboard & Analytics card navigates correctly
âœ… Payment Info menu item navigates correctly

## Files Modified

### Created
- `src/screens/PaymentInfoScreen.tsx`
- `src/screens/DashboardAnalyticsScreen.tsx`
- `src/services/UserStatsService.ts`

### Modified
- `src/screens/ProfileScreen.tsx` (major UI redesign)
- `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx` (added routes)
- `src/types/navigation.ts` (added types)

## Next Steps

### Backend Implementation Required
To fully support the new features, the backend needs to implement:

1. **GET /api/users/stats** endpoint
   - Returns: `{ reviews: number, listings: number, favorites: number, views: number }`

2. **GET /api/users/listings** endpoint
   - Returns array of user listings with:
     - id, title, type, views, favorites, shares, createdAt, updatedAt
     - Optional: categoryKey, businessId

### Future Enhancements
- Implement actual Payment Info functionality
- Add filtering/sorting to Dashboard Analytics
- Add date range selection for analytics
- Implement real-time stat updates
- Add charts/graphs to dashboard
- Export analytics data

## Notes

- All existing functionality has been preserved
- Guest user experience maintained with appropriate limitations
- Mock data is used as fallback when backend endpoints are unavailable
- Navigation is type-safe with proper TypeScript definitions
- Consistent with app's design system and UX patterns
- Proper error handling and loading states throughout
