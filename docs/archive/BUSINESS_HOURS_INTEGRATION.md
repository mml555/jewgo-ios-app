# Business Hours Integration Summary

## Overview
Successfully integrated the new enhanced business hours components into the existing form system, replacing the old modal-based time picker with a modern, inline iOS DatePicker experience.

## Components Implemented

- **24-hour to 12-hour conversion** for user-friendly display
- **Accessibility support** with proper labels and screen reader compatibility
- **Error state handling** with visual feedback
- **Disabled state support** for conditional interactions

### 2. DayHoursRow (`src/components/DayHoursRow.tsx`)
- **Day-specific controls** with open/closed toggle
- **Inline time pickers** for opening and closing times
- **Next Day toggle** for businesses open past midnight
- **Copy hours functionality** to duplicate settings to other days
- **Real-time validation** with immediate error feedback

### 3. BusinessHoursSelector (`src/components/BusinessHoursSelector.tsx`)

- **Smart defaults** (weekdays 9-5, weekends 10-6, Sunday closed)
- **Bulk operations** for quick setup:
  - Set all weekdays to 9 AM - 5 PM

  - Reasonable business hours (warnings)
  - Consistent patterns (suggestions)
- **Real-time feedback** with immediate error detection
- **Recovery suggestions** for fixing validation issues
- **Utility functions** for time conversion and formatting

## Integration with Existing Form

### Data Format Conversion
The integration maintains backward compatibility with the existing form data structure:

```typescript
// Legacy format (existing)
business_hours: Array<{
  day: string;
  openTime: string; // "9:00 AM"
  closeTime: string; // "5:00 PM"
  isClosed: boolean;
}>

// New internal format
BusinessHoursData: {
  [day: string]: {
    day: string;
    isOpen: boolean;
    openTime: string; // "09:00" (24-hour)
    closeTime: string; // "17:00" (24-hour)
    isNextDay: boolean;
  }
}
```

### Conversion Functions
- **`convertToBusinessHoursData()`**: Converts legacy 12-hour format to new 24-hour format
- **`convertFromBusinessHoursData()`**: Converts back to legacy format for form submission
- **Automatic time format conversion** between 12-hour display and 24-hour storage
