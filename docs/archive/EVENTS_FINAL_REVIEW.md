## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Authentication Configuration
The authentication middleware is correctly applied at the **router level** in `server.js`:

```javascript
app.use(
  '/api/v5/events',
  authSystem.getAuthMiddleware().requireAuthOrGuest(),
  eventsRoutes,
);
```

The commented-out `authenticate()` calls in `backend/src/routes/events.js` are **intentional** since authentication is already handled by the middleware above. This applies to all routes under `/api/v5/events`.

### Field Mapping Strategy
The implementation maintains **backward compatibility** with existing schema while adding new computed fields and views. This approach allows:
- Existing code to continue working
- New features to use enhanced fields
- Gradual migration path
- No breaking changes
