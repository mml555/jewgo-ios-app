# ✅ Events Page Now Active!

## Problem Identified & Fixed

**Issue**: Events page wasn't showing any data because:
1. Database had 0 events (now fixed - 15 events seeded ✅)
2. HomeScreen wasn't routing to EventsScreen when "Events" category selected (now fixed ✅)

## What Was Done

### 1. Database Population ✅
- **Seeded 15 diverse events** with proper data
- All events are approved and upcoming
- Categories, types, RSVPs, and analytics included

### 2. Navigation Fix ✅
**File**: `src/screens/HomeScreen.tsx`

**Changed**: When user taps "Events" in CategoryRail, now shows `EventsScreen` instead of generic `CategoryGridScreen`

```typescript
// Before (line 75-82):
{activeCategory === 'jobs' ? (
  <EnhancedJobsScreen />
) : (
  <CategoryGridScreen ... />
)}

// After (line 76-86):
{activeCategory === 'jobs' ? (
  <EnhancedJobsScreen />
) : activeCategory === 'events' ? (
  <EventsScreen />              // ← NEW!
) : (
  <CategoryGridScreen ... />
)}
```

### 3. Database Verified ✅
```
✓ 15 Total Events
✓ 15 Upcoming Events (next 30 days)
✓ 10 Free Events
✓ 5 Paid Events
✓ All approved and visible
```
