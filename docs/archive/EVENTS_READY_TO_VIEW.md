### 🔍 Troubleshooting

#### If Events Still Don't Appear:

1. **Check Backend Logs**:
   ```bash
   # Look for any errors in backend terminal
   ```

2. **Verify Database**:
   ```bash
   PGPASSWORD=jewgo_dev_password psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U jewgo_user -d jewgo_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM events;"
   ```
   Should show: `15`

3. **Check API Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   # Create guest session and test (wait 15 minutes if rate limited)
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/v5/auth/guest/create
   ```

4. **Clear App Cache**:
   ```bash
   # In Expo Dev Tools
   npx expo start -c
   ```

### 📱 Authentication Note

The `/api/v5/events` endpoint requires authentication (guest or user session). This is already handled in your app, so when you open the Events page in the mobile app, it will:

1. Automatically use your existing session
2. Or create a guest session if needed
3. Then load and display all 15 events

### ✨ What You'll See

Your Events page will now display beautiful cards with:
- 🖼️ Event flyers (Cloudinary URLs)
- 📍 Location info (Brooklyn, Manhattan)
- 📅 Dates (all upcoming in next 30 days)
- 💰 Free/Paid badges
- ❤️ Favorite hearts
- 🏷️ Category pills
