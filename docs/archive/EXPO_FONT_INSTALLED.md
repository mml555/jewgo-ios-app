# âœ… Missing Package Installed: expo-font

## Problem
```
Unable to resolve module expo-font from .../node_modules/@expo/vector-icons/build/createIconSet.js
```

The `@expo/vector-icons` package requires `expo-font` but it wasn't installed.

## Solution Applied

```bash
npm install expo-font --legacy-peer-deps
```

âœ… **Successfully installed `expo-font` package**

## What Happened

`@expo/vector-icons` (used for icons in the app) depends on `expo-font` for loading custom fonts. This dependency was missing from your `node_modules`.

## Next Step

**Reload your app** to pick up the new package:

### Option 1: In the app (recommended)
- Shake device
- Tap "Reload"

### Option 2: Restart Metro bundler
```bash
# Stop the current process (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# Then restart:
npx expo start
```

### Option 3: Clear cache and restart
```bash
# Stop Metro
# Then:
npx expo start --clear
```

## Status

**Package Installed**: âœ… `expo-font`  
**Dependencies**: âœ… Added 2 packages  
**Ready**: âœ… Reload app to use
