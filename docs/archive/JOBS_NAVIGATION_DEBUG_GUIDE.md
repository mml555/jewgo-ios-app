# Jobs Navigation Debug Guide

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed API Response Format
- **File**: `backend/src/controllers/jobsController.js`
- **Change**: Updated `getJobListings` to return:
  ```javascript
  {
    success: true,
    data: {
      listings: result.rows
    },
    pagination: { ... }
  }
  ```
- **Previous**: Was returning `{ jobListings: result.rows }`
- **Issue Fixed**: Frontend expected `data.listings` format

### 2. Created Jobs Table
- Created `jobs` table with all necessary fields
- Added 5 sample job listings to the database
- Jobs are now available for the "I'm Hiring" page

### 3. Made Plus Button Dynamic
- **File**: `src/screens/EnhancedJobsScreen.tsx`
- **Change**: The middle button now changes based on active tab:
  - Shows "I'm Hiring +" when on "Job feed" tab
  - Shows "I'm Seeking +" when on "Resume Feed" tab
- **Navigation**: 
  - "I'm Hiring +" navigates to `CreateJobV2` screen
  - "I'm Seeking +" navigates to `CreateJobSeekerProfile` screen

## Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Verify Tabs Switch Properly
1. Open the Jobs section (Jobs icon in CategoryRail)
2. You should see 3 tabs: "Job feed", "I'm Hiring +", "Resume Feed"
3. Click "Job feed" - should show job listings
4. Click "Resume Feed" - should show job seeker profiles
5. **Check Console**: Look for debug logs like:
   - "Setting activeTab to jobs"
   - "Setting activeTab to seekers"

### Test 2: Verify Plus Button Changes
1. When on "Job feed" tab, the middle button should say "I'm Hiring +"
2. When on "Resume Feed" tab, the middle button should say "I'm Seeking +"
3. **Check Console**: Look for log showing current activeTab

### Test 3: Verify Plus Button Navigation
1. Click the "I'm Hiring +" button (when on Job feed)
2. Should navigate to Create Job screen
3. **Check Console**: Look for:
   - "üéØ Plus button pressed, activeTab: jobs"
   - "üéØ Navigating to CreateJobV2"
4. Go back, switch to "Resume Feed" tab
5. Click the "I'm Seeking +" button
6. Should navigate to Create Job Seeker Profile screen
7. **Check Console**: Look for:
   - "üéØ Plus button pressed, activeTab: seekers"
   - "üéØ Navigating to CreateJobSeekerProfile"

## Possible Issues

### Issue 1: Button Not Responding to Touches
**Symptoms**: Clicking the button does nothing
**Possible Causes**:
- TouchableOpacity is being covered by another element
- Button is outside the touchable area
- Navigation is failing silently

**Debug**:
1. Check console for "üéØ Plus button pressed" log
2. If you DON'T see this log, the touch isn't registering
3. If you DO see this log but no navigation happens, check for error logs

### Issue 2: Navigation Routes Not Found
**Symptoms**: Error in console about undefined route
**Solution**: Verify routes in `src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`:
- `CreateJobV2` should exist
- `CreateJobSeekerProfile` should exist

### Issue 3: Tabs Not Switching
**Symptoms**: Clicking "Job feed" or "Resume Feed" doesn't change content
**Debug**:
1. Check console for "Setting activeTab to..." logs
2. Verify `activeTab` state is changing
3. Check if `loadData` is being called when tab changes

## Current State

‚úÖ **Backend**: Jobs table created, sample data added, API endpoint fixed
‚úÖ **Frontend**: Dynamic button text implemented with navigation logic
‚úÖ **Navigation**: Routes confirmed to exist in AppNavigator
‚úÖ **Lookup Endpoints**: Fixed authentication issue - created public endpoints for industries, job types, etc.
‚úÖ **Create Job Screen**: Should now load properly without "Endpoint not found" errors
‚è≥ **Testing**: Ready for user testing

## Next Steps if Still Not Working

1. **Check React Native Metro bundler**: Ensure app has reloaded with new changes
2. **Check for TypeScript errors**: Run `npx tsc --noEmit` to verify no type errors
3. **Verify navigation context**: Ensure `useNavigation()` hook is working properly
4. **Test simpler navigation**: Try navigating to a different screen to verify navigation works at all
5. **Check device logs**: Look for any crash reports or errors in device logs
