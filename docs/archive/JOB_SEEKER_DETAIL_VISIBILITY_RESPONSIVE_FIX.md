# Job Seeker Detail Screen - Text Visibility & Responsive Design Fix

## Problem
The job seeker detail screen had two critical issues:
1. **Text visibility problems** - Text was not clearly visible due to poor color contrast
2. **Missing responsive design** - Layout was not adaptive to different screen sizes

## Solution
Completely overhauled the JobSeekerDetailScreen to fix text visibility and implement responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Text Visibility Fixes**

#### **1. Improved Color Contrast**
- **Changed all text colors** from `Colors.text.secondary` to `Colors.text.primary` for better visibility
- **Enhanced font weights** - Added `fontWeight: '600'` and `fontWeight: '700'` for better readability
- **Fixed profile image placeholder** - Changed from `Colors.primary.light` to `Colors.primary.main` for better contrast
- **Improved skill tags** - Changed from `Colors.primary.light` to `Colors.primary.main` with white text

#### **2. Enhanced Typography**
- **Consistent font sizes** across all screen sizes
- **Better line heights** for improved readability

```
