# https://fbflipper.com/

# Install React Native Flipper
npm install --save-dev react-native-flipper

# Setup complete instructions in:
MEMORY_LEAK_DEEP_DIVE.md (Section: Flipper Setup)
```

### 2. Chrome DevTools (5 minutes)

```bash
# Start Metro with debugging

---

## 🚨 If Tests Fail

### 1. Check the Documentation

```bash
# Read troubleshooting section
cat MEMORY_LEAK_DEEP_DIVE.md | grep -A 20 "Troubleshooting"
```

### 2. Run Profiler

```bash
# Get detailed memory analysis
npm run memory:profile

# Check the report
cat memory-test-reports/*.json
```

### 3. Take Heap Snapshots

```bash
# Compare before/after
npm run memory:snapshot

# Analyze with Chrome DevTools
# Load snapshots in chrome://inspect
```

### 4. Common Issues

**Issue:** Tests fail with "memory growth exceeded"
**Solution:**

- Run garbage collection: `node --expose-gc`
- Check for new leaks: Review recent code changes
- Run profiler: `npm run debug:memory`

**Issue:** "gc is not a function"
**Solution:**

- Add `--expose-gc` flag to test command
- Update test script in package.json

**Issue:** Snapshots growing unexpectedly
**Solution:**

- Review MEMORY_LEAK_DEEP_DIVE.md (Advanced Detection)
- Run heap snapshot comparison
- Check for closures capturing large objects
