## üåê Backend Reload - Render Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Deploy (Recommended)

1. **Go to Render Dashboard**:

   - Find your service: `jewgo-backend` (or similar name)

2. **Trigger Manual Deploy**:

   - Click on your service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
   - Or click "Deploy" ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"

3. **Monitor Deployment**:
   - Watch the logs in real-time
   - Wait for "Deploy live" status
   - Usually takes 2-5 minutes

### Option 2: Render CLI Deploy

```bash
# Install Render CLI (if not already installed)
brew install render

# Login to Render
render login

# Deploy your service
render deploy
```

### Option 3: Git Push Deploy (Auto)

```bash
# If you have auto-deploy enabled on main branch
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy: AsyncStorage migration and crash fixes"
git push origin main

# Render will auto-deploy if connected to repo
```

### Option 4: Render API Deploy

```bash
# Get your deploy hook URL from Render Dashboard
# Settings ‚Üí Deploy Hook

# Trigger deploy via curl
curl -X POST https://api.render.com/deploy/YOUR_DEPLOY_HOOK_ID
```

## üí° Tips

### Metro Bundler

- If Metro stops, run: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- Clear cache if issues: `npx react-native start --reset-cache`
- Check port 8081 is not in use

### Render Backend

- First deploy after code changes takes longer (build + deploy)
- Subsequent deploys are faster
- Free tier may spin down after inactivity (takes ~30 sec to wake)
- Check "Deploys" tab for deploy history

### Testing New Fixes

- Test navigation with missing params (should show alert)
- Test offline mode (should not crash)
- Test form persistence (should save/restore)
- Test error scenarios (should show error boundaries)
