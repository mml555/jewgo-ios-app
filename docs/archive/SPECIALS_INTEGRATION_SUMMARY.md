## User Flow

### From Eatery Details to Specials
1. User views an eatery detail page
2. Sees current specials for that business (up to 3 displayed)
3. Clicks "View All" to see all specials for that business
4. Navigates to specials page filtered by business
5. Can click on individual specials to view details

2. Clicks on a special card
3. Views special details with business information
4. Can navigate to the business details page
5. Returns to see all specials for that business

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
- Uses `specialsService.getRestaurantSpecials()` for business-specific specials
- Uses `specialsService.getActiveSpecials()` for general specials
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Data transformation between API formats and component interfaces

### Component Architecture
```

│   ├── Error handling
│   ├── Empty states
│   └── Interactive special cards
└── Navigation integration

ListingDetailScreen
├── BusinessSpecials integration
├── Navigation to filtered specials
└── Individual special navigation
```

### Navigation Flow
```
MainTabs (Specials) ←→ SpecialDetail
     ↑                    ↓
ListingDetailScreen ←→ BusinessSpecials
```

## Design Consistency

### Visual Design

- Screen reader support
- Touch target sizes meet accessibility guidelines
- Semantic navigation structure

## Error Handling

### Network Errors
- Graceful fallback when API calls fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms where appropriate
- Loading states to indicate progress

### Empty States
- Clear messaging when no specials are available
- Encouraging users to check back later
- Visual indicators (icons) for better UX

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- Efficient API calls with proper caching
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Optimized re-renders with proper memoization
- Background refresh capabilities

### Component Optimization
- Memoized components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Efficient list rendering with proper key extraction
- Optimized image loading and caching

## Future Enhancements
