# Get job seekers (requires guest or user token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/v5/jobs/seekers?limit=10
```

---

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **If Forms Don't Show Fields:**
1. Check React Native console for errors
2. Verify backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
3. Check if lookup data is loading (look for console logs: "üîÑ Loading lookup data from API...")
4. Verify no network errors in console

### **If "Endpoint not found" Error:**
1. Backend might not have restarted
2. Try: `lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9 && cd backend && npm start`
3. Wait 3-5 seconds for backend to fully start

### **If Forms Load But Dropdowns Are Empty:**
1. Check if lookup endpoints are working
2. Open browser: http://localhost:3001/api/v5/jobs/industries
3. Should return JSON with industries array
4. If 404, backend routes might be wrong

### **If Submission Fails:**
1. Check backend console for error messages
2. Verify database is running: `pg_isready -h localhost -p 5433`
3. Check if migration ran: `psql -U jewgo_user -d jewgo_dev -h localhost -p 5433 -c "\d jobs"`
4. Look for new columns in output

### **If Jobs Feed Shows No Data:**
1. Check if jobs exist in database:
   ```sql
   psql -U jewgo_user -d jewgo_dev -h localhost -p 5433 -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM jobs;"
   ```
2. Verify authentication is working (check for guest token)
3. Look for API errors in React Native console
