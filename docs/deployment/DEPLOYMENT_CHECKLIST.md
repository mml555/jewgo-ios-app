## Backend Deployment (Railway)

### Step 1: Generate Secrets

- [ ] Run `node backend/scripts/generate-secrets.js`

- [ ] Keep secrets ready for environment variable setup

### Step 2: Create Project

- [ ] Create new project on Railway
- [ ] Deploy from GitHub repository
- [ ] Select correct repository
- [ ] Set root directory to `/backend`
- [ ] Wait for initial deployment

### Step 3: Add Database

- [ ] Add PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Database provisioned successfully

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Set `PORT=3001`
- [ ] Set `DB_SSL=true`
- [ ] Add `JWT_SECRET` (from Step 1)
- [ ] Add `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET` (from Step 1)
- [ ] Set JWT configuration (`JWT_ACCESS_TTL`, `JWT_REFRESH_TTL`, etc.)
- [ ] Set `CORS_ORIGIN=*` (for testing)
- [ ] Link database (adds `DATABASE_URL`, `DB_HOST`, etc.)
- [ ] Set rate limiting variables
- [ ] Set logging variables

### Step 5: Generate Domain

- [ ] Generate public domain in Railway
- [ ] Copy domain URL (e.g., `https://jewgo-backend.up.railway.app`)
- [ ] Test domain is accessible

### Step 6: Setup Database

- [ ] Install Railway CLI: `npm install -g @railway/cli`
- [ ] Login: `railway login`
- [ ] Link project: `railway link`
- [ ] Run setup script: `railway run ./backend/scripts/setup-database.sh $DATABASE_URL`
- [ ] Verify tables created: `railway run psql -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM entities;"`

### Step 7: Verify Deployment

- [ ] Run health check: `./backend/scripts/health-check.sh https://your-url.railway.app`
- [ ] Health endpoint returns `"status": "healthy"`
- [ ] Database connection working
- [ ] Check Railway logs for errors
- [ ] No critical errors in logs

---

## iOS App Configuration

### Step 1: Create Production Config

- [ ] Copy `.env` to `.env.production`
- [ ] Update `API_BASE_URL` with Railway URL + `/api/v5`
- [ ] Verify `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Add Google API keys if needed
- [ ] Save file

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

- [ ] Check `ConfigService.ts` uses `Config.API_BASE_URL` in production
- [ ] Verify `__DEV__` flag detection working
- [ ] No hardcoded localhost URLs in code

### Step 3: Build for Testing

- [ ] Open Xcode: `open ios/JewgoAppFinal.xcworkspace`
- [ ] Connect iOS device via USB
- [ ] Select physical device in Xcode
- [ ] Change scheme to "Release" (Product â†’ Scheme â†’ Edit Scheme)
- [ ] Clean build folder (âŒ˜+Shift+K)
- [ ] Build and run (âŒ˜+R)

### Step 4: Test on Device

- [ ] App installs successfully
- [ ] App launches without crashes
- [ ] Network requests go to Railway URL (check logs)
- [ ] Login/authentication works
- [ ] Can fetch entities, events, jobs
- [ ] Can create favorites
- [ ] Can view details screens
- [ ] Maps and location work
- [ ] Images load correctly
- [ ] No network errors in app
