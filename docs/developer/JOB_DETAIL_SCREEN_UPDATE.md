## Component Reusability Benefits

### Components Now Shared Between Screens
1. **DetailHeaderBar** (`src/components/DetailHeaderBar.tsx`)
   - Used by: ListingDetailScreen, JobDetailScreen
   - Purpose: Consistent navigation and action bar
   - Customizable: Center content and right content variants

2. **ImageCarousel** (`src/components/ImageCarousel.tsx`)
   - Used by: ListingDetailScreen (only)
   - Purpose: Display image galleries with navigation
   - Not used for jobs: Jobs are text-focused and don't require images

### Future Reusability
These components can be easily reused in other detail screens:
- Special Detail Screen
- Mikvah/Synagogue Detail Screen
- Shtetl Store Detail Screen
- Event Detail Screen (if added)
