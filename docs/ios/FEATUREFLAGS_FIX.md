# React-featureflags Header Fix

## ‚ùå **The Problem**

React Native 0.76.x moved featureflags headers to a new location:
```
node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/react/featureflags/
```

The include statement is:
```cpp
#include <react/featureflags/ReactNativeFeatureFlagsAccessor.h>
```

For this to work, the compiler needs `ReactCommon` (the **parent** of `react/`) in `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`.

---

## ‚úÖ **The Fix**

Updated `ios/Podfile` to add `ReactCommon` parent directory to all React pod targets:

### Changes Made:

1. **Added ReactCommon paths to `fix_rn076_headers`:**
   ```ruby
   rn_paths = [
     # ... existing paths ...
     "#{pods_root}/Headers/Public/React-featureflags",
     "#{pods_root}/Headers/Private/React-featureflags",
     "${PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT}/../../ReactCommon",      # Parent of "react/"
     "${PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT}/../../ReactCommon/**",   # Recursive
     # ... other paths ...
   ]
   ```

2. **Added React-featureflags to touched targets:**
   ```ruby
   touched = %w[
     React-Core React-CoreModules React-cxxreact React-hermes
     React-RCTFabric React-Fabric React-RuntimeCore React-logger
     React-runtimes-yoga React-runtimes React-jsi React-callinvoker
     React-featureflags  # ‚Üê ADDED
     RCTTypeSafety RCT-Folly Yoga
     RNScreens RNGestureHandler react-native-safe-area-context
   ]
   ```

3. **Added explicit libc++ setting:**
   ```ruby
   bs['CLANG_CXX_LIBRARY'] = 'libc++'  # Avoids toolchain wobble
   ```

## üìä **Result**

After `pod install`:
```
üéØ RN 0.76.x header fix applied to 19 target groups
‚úÖ Folly, Yoga, React-Core, React-featureflags headers + libc++ configured
```

**19 pod targets** now have:
- ‚úÖ `ReactCommon` parent directory in header paths
- ‚úÖ `ReactCommon/**` recursive search
- ‚úÖ `gnu++17` C++ standard
- ‚úÖ `libc++` standard library
- ‚úÖ `FOLLY_NO_CONFIG=1` preprocessor define

---

## üîç **Verification**

The fix ensures:
1. Compiler can find `react/featureflags/ReactNativeFeatureFlagsAccessor.h`
2. All React internal includes resolve correctly
3. C++ standard library is consistent across all targets

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ignored Warnings**

These are **safe to ignore**:
- `glog` syscall deprecation warnings (iOS 10+ issue, non-fatal)
- `[CP-User]` scripts run every build (expected behavior)
- "Update to recommended settings" (don't apply until build succeeds)

---

## üöÄ **Next Steps**

The featureflags header issue is resolved. Build with:
```bash
open ios/JewgoAppFinal.xcworkspace
# Press ‚åòB to build in Xcode
```

Or:
```bash
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 16"
```

**This fix is part of the production-ready RN 0.76.9 iOS configuration!** ‚úÖ
