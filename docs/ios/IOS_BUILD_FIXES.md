## Critical Issues & Solutions

### ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL: Yoga Layout Engine Fix (React Native 0.76.x)**

**What is Yoga?**
Yoga is React Native's **core layout engine** that powers ALL layout in your app. It implements the CSS Flexbox model and is absolutely essential - React Native cannot function without it. Every `<View>`, `<Text>`, and component uses Yoga to calculate positions and sizes.

**Issue:** React Native 0.76.x changed the Yoga directory structure. Yoga's C++ source files use self-referencing includes like `#include <yoga/numeric/Comparison.h>`, but CocoaPods doesn't set up the header search paths correctly for these internal references.

**Symptoms:**
```
error: 'yoga/numeric/Comparison.h' file not found
error: 'yoga/algorithm/Cache.h' file not found
error: 'yoga/debug/AssertFatal.h' file not found
error: 'yoga/algorithm/PixelGrid.h' file not found
```

**Solution - TWO PARTS:**

#### Part 1: Yoga.podspec Modification (Permanent)
The file `node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/Yoga.podspec` has been modified to add the correct header search path. This change is preserved via `patch-package`:

```ruby
spec.pod_target_xcconfig = {
    'DEFINES_MODULE' => 'YES',
    'HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS' => '"$(PODS_ROOT)/../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga" "$(PODS_TARGET_SRCROOT)"'
}
```

**Patch File:** `patches/react-native+0.76.9.patch`

**To Apply:** Run `npm install` which automatically applies patches via `postinstall`

#### Part 2: Symbolic Links (After Every `pod install`)
After running `pod install`, you **MUST** create symbolic links for Yoga subdirectories:

```bash
# Quick fix - run this script:
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh

# Or manually create the symbolic links:
cd ios/Pods/Headers/Public/Yoga

ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/numeric numeric
ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/enums enums
ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/config config
ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/debug debug
ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/algorithm algorithm
ln -sf $PWD/../../../../../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/event event
```

**Why Both Are Needed:**
1. **Yoga.podspec fix**: Adds the parent directory to header search paths so `yoga/numeric/...` can resolve
2. **Symbolic links**: Ensure headers are accessible in the Public headers directory
3. **Together**: They provide multiple resolution paths, ensuring Yoga compiles successfully

**When to Run:**
- âœ… After `npm install` (patch applied automatically)
- âœ… **After `pod install`** (run `./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh`)
- âœ… After `pod install --repo-update`
- âœ… After deleting and reinstalling the `Pods` directory  
- âœ… Before building the iOS app for the first time
- âœ… When you see Yoga header errors during build

### 2. **rsync Sandbox Restrictions**

**Issue:** macOS sandboxing prevents `rsync` from executing in Xcode build scripts, causing build failures.

**Symptoms:**
```
error: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code
rsync: failed to set times on "...": Operation not permitted
```

**Solution:**
Modified `ios/Podfile` to replace `rsync` with `ditto` (macOS-native, sandbox-safe tool).

**Podfile Changes:**
```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  # ... existing code ...
  
  # SECTION 2: Rsync Sandbox Fix
  puts "\nðŸ”§ Replacing rsync with ditto in CocoaPods scripts..."
  
  rsync_fixes_applied = 0
  Dir.glob("Pods/Target Support Files/**/*.sh") do |script_path|
    script_content = File.read(script_path)
    original_content = script_content.dup
    
    # Replace rsync commands with ditto
    script_content.gsub!(/rsync\s+--delete.*?\s+"?\$\{source\}"?\/?(\*\s+)?"?\$\{destination\}"?/) do |match|
      'ditto "${source}" "${destination}"'
    end
    
    if script_content != original_content
      File.write(script_path, script_content)
      rsync_fixes_applied += 1
    end
  end
  
  puts "  ðŸ“Š Total rsync->ditto fixes applied: #{rsync_fixes_applied} files"
end
```

**Status:** âœ… Permanently fixed in `ios/Podfile`

---

### 3. **Yoga Header Search Paths**

**Issue:** Xcode couldn't find Yoga headers even though they exist in the Pods directory.

**Solution:**
Added comprehensive header search paths in `ios/Podfile`.

**Podfile Changes:**
```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  # ... existing code ...
  
  # SECTION 3: Yoga Header Fix
  puts "\nðŸ§˜ Fixing Yoga header paths for React Native 0.76.x..."
  
  yoga_header_paths = [
    '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Yoga/yoga"',
    '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Headers/Public/Yoga"',
    '"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga"',
    '"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/numeric"',
    '"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/enums"',
    '"$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native/ReactCommon/yoga/yoga/config"'
  ]
  
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    if ['Yoga', 'React-Core', 'React-Fabric', 'React-FabricComponents'].include?(target.name)
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] ||= []
        yoga_header_paths.each do |path|
          config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << path
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

**Status:** âœ… Permanently fixed in `ios/Podfile`

---

### 4. **Deployment Target Standardization**

**Issue:** CocoaPods warnings about mismatched deployment targets across dependencies.

**Solution:**
Standardized all pods to iOS 15.0 in `ios/Podfile`.

**Podfile Changes:**
```ruby
post_install do |installer|
  puts "\nðŸ“± Configuring deployment targets..."
  
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '15.0'
      puts "  âœ… #{target.name}: iOS 15.0"
    end
  end
end
```

**Status:** âœ… Permanently fixed in `ios/Podfile`

## Complete Build Workflow

### First Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# 2. Install CocoaPods
cd ios
pod install --repo-update

# 3. Fix Yoga headers (CRITICAL!)
cd ..
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh

# 4. Clean build directories
rm -rf ios/build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

# 5. Build the app
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 16"
```

### After Running `pod install`

```bash
# ALWAYS run this after pod install!
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh

# Then build normally
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Clean Build

```bash
# Full clean and rebuild
rm -rf node_modules
rm -rf ios/Pods ios/Podfile.lock ios/build
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

npm install --legacy-peer-deps
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# CRITICAL: Fix Yoga headers
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh

# Build
npx react-native run-ios
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "yoga/numeric/Comparison.h file not found"

**Cause:** Yoga symbolic links are missing.

**Fix:**
```bash
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh
```

### "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code"

**Cause:** rsync sandbox restrictions.

**Fix:** This should be permanently fixed in the Podfile. If you still see this:
```bash
cd ios
pod install  # Re-run to apply Podfile fixes
```

### Build Succeeds But App Crashes on Launch

**Causes:**
1. Metro bundler not running
2. Stale bundle cache

**Fix:**
```bash
# Kill any existing Metro processes
pkill -f "react-native start"

# Start Metro with clean cache
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# In a new terminal, build the app
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Xcode DerivedData Issues

**Symptoms:** Random build failures, "file not found" errors that don't make sense.

**Fix:**
```bash
# Clear Xcode's derived data
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/*

# Clean and rebuild
cd ios
xcodebuild clean -workspace JewgoAppFinal.xcworkspace -scheme JewgoAppFinal
cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Automated Fix Script

We've created a helper script that automatically fixes the Yoga headers: `scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh`

**Usage:**
```bash
./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh
```

**What it does:**
1. Checks if Yoga source and headers directories exist
2. Removes old symbolic links
3. Creates new symbolic links for all Yoga subdirectories
4. Displays verification output

**Add to your workflow:**
```bash
# After pod install, always run:
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && ./scripts/fix-yoga-headers.sh
```
