- âœ… Job benefits (tag chip format)
- âœ… Job description (200 char limit)
- âœ… All content fits on screen (no scrolling needed)
- âœ… Works on all iPhone sizes (SE to Pro Max)

---

## Files Modified

### Backend (3 files)

1. `backend/src/routes/jobs.js`

   - Added backwards compatibility route `/api/v5/jobs/:id`

2. `backend/src/controllers/jobsController.js`

   - Fixed guest user UUID handling
   - Added `business_id` and `employer_id` filters
   - Removed dependency on non-existent `saved_jobs` table

3. `backend/src/database/migrations/024_add_business_entity_to_jobs_v2.sql`
   - Added `business_entity_id` column to jobs table
   - Created index for performance
   - Created `business_hiring_summary` view

### Frontend (2 files)

1. `src/screens/JobDetailScreen.tsx`

   - Complete redesign with responsive flexbox layout
   - Added requirements section (250 char plain text)
   - Added benefits section (tag chips)
   - Character limits enforced (200 for description, 250 for requirements)
   - No scrolling needed

2. `src/services/JobsService.ts`
   - Updated types to support `string | string[]` for requirements/benefits
   - Added `business_id` filter support

### Database (2 files)

1. `database/migrations/024_add_business_entity_to_jobs_v2.sql`

   - Migration script for production

2. `database/scripts/create_sample_jobs_local.sql`
   - Sample data for local development (4 jobs with requirements & benefits)

## Key Features

### 1. Requirements Section

```
Requirements
3+ years development experience, React and Node.js proficiency, Portfolio of work
```

- Plain text format
- 250 character maximum
- Comma-separated list
- Truncates with "..." if too long

### 2. Benefits Section

```
Benefits
[Health insurance] [401k matching] [Flexible hours]
[Shabbat-friendly] [Remote work options]
```

- Tag chip format
- White background with green border
- Wraps to multiple rows
- 12px font size

### 3. Responsive Layout

- Uses flexbox with `justifyContent: 'space-between'`
- Automatically distributes cards across available screen height
- Works on all screen sizes without scrolling
- Font sizes: 12-17px (readable and compact)
- Spacing: 6-12px (balanced)

---

## Technical Highlights

### Responsive Scaling

All measurements use responsive functions:

```typescript
scale(14); // Horizontal â†’ adapts to screen width
verticalScale(8); // Vertical â†’ adapts to screen height
moderateScale(15); // Fonts â†’ balanced scaling
```

### Flexbox Layout

```typescript
contentContainer: {
  flex: 1,                          // Fill screen
  justifyContent: 'space-between',  // Distribute evenly
  paddingHorizontal: scale(14),
  paddingVertical: verticalScale(8),
}
```

### Character Truncation

```typescript
// About Job (200 chars)
{
  job.description.substring(0, 200) +
    (job.description.length > 200 ? '...' : '');
}

// Requirements (250 chars)
{
  Array.isArray(job.requirements)
    ? job.requirements.join(', ').substring(0, 250) + '...'
    : job.requirements.substring(0, 250) + '...';
}
```

| iPhone 13/14   | 390 x 844   | âœ… Optimal          |
| iPhone Pro Max | 428 x 926   | âœ… Generous spacing |

**All devices:** No scrolling required âœ…
