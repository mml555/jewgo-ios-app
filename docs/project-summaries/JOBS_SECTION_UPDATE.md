# Business Jobs Section Update

## Overview

Added a new "I'm Hiring" section to business listing detail pages that displays job postings from businesses with character limits for better UI/UX.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: `BusinessJobsSection.tsx`

Created a new component that displays job postings for a business on their detail page.

**Features:**

- Displays up to 3 job postings in a horizontal scrollable list
- **About section limited to 200 characters** (truncated with "...")
- **Requirements section limited to 250 characters** (truncated with "...")
- Shows job title, type, salary, and location
- "View All" button when there are more than the max display count
- Handles loading and error states gracefully
- Only shows when jobs are available (hidden if no jobs)

**Character Limits:**

```typescript
truncateText(item.description, 200); // About section: 200 chars
truncateText(item.requirements, 250); // Requirements section: 250 chars
```

### 2. Updated `ListingDetailScreen.tsx`

- Imported the new `BusinessJobsSection` component
- Added the component after the Business Specials section
- Added visual divider for better separation

### 3. Updated `JobsService.ts`

- Extended the `getJobListings` method to support filtering by:
  - `business_id`: Filter jobs by business ID
  - `employer_id`: Filter jobs by employer ID

## UI Design

### Job Card Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Job Title              Type │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ About:                      │
│ [200 char description...]   │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Requirements:               │
│ [250 char requirements...]  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ 💰 Salary    📍 Location   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Visual Hierarchy

1. **Header**: "💼 I'm Hiring" with "View All" link
2. **Horizontal Scrollable List**: Job cards
3. **Job Card Components**:
   - Job Title (bold, largest text)
   - Job Type badge (green pill)
   - About section (200 chars max)
   - Requirements section (250 chars max)
   - Footer with salary and location

## Integration

The jobs section appears on business listing detail pages in this order:

1. Business Description
2. Business Specials
3. **→ Business Jobs (NEW)**
4. Social Media Links
5. About Us (Long Description)
6. Customer Reviews

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Character limits ensure cards are uniform and scannable
2. **Space Efficient**: Truncation allows more information without overwhelming users
3. **Consistent Design**: Matches the existing Business Specials component pattern
4. **Performance**: Only loads jobs when needed, gracefully handles errors
5. **Mobile Friendly**: Horizontal scroll works well on mobile devices

## Testing Recommendations

To test this feature:

1. Navigate to any business listing detail page
2. The "I'm Hiring" section will appear if the business has job postings
3. Verify that:
   - About sections are truncated at 200 characters
   - Requirements sections are truncated at 250 characters
   - Clicking a job card navigates to the job detail page
   - "View All" button works if more than 3 jobs exist

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. Add filtering options (job type, salary range)
2. Show applicant count on cards
3. Add "Apply Now" quick action button
4. Show posting date/time
5. Add bookmarking functionality directly from cards
