## Getting Started

### What You'll Need
Before starting, gather the following information:

- **Business Hours**: Operating hours for each day of the week

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Business Ownership & Basic Information

**What we need:**

**Common Issues:**

### Step 2: Kosher Certification

**What we need:**

**Tips:**
- ✅ Select the primary kosher category for your establishment

**Pro Tips:**
